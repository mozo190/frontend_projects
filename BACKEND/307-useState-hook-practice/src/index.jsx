import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./components/App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

//Challenge:



//2. Given that you can get code to be called every second
//using the setInterval method.
//Can you get the time in your <h1> to update every second?

//e.g. uncomment the code below to see Hey printed every second.
// function sayHi() {
//   console.log("Hey");
// }
// setInterval(sayHi, 1000);

// If you're running this locally in VS Code use the commands:
// npm install
// to install the node modules and
// npm run dev
// to launch your react project in your browser
